Testing Git + Github.

Research and understand what a merge conflict is and how to resolve it.

A merge conflict occurs when the same line in a file has several changes or if one person edits a line in a file and another person deletes that file.

To resolve a merge conflict you will want to review the changes and decide if you want to keep your changes, the changes the other person made or create a new file with both changes.

 Reseach the Git commands pull, rebase, merge. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch.
 
 Push - uploads all local branch commits to GitHub.
 Rebase - This is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit, another way of merging.
 Merge - Combines bookmark's branch into current local branch.
 
 Reseach the Git commands reset , revert, clean. These commands will allow you to go back and ammends previous commits you have made.
 
 Reset - Restages your file but preserves its contents, undoes all commits on a file.
 Revert - This command will create a new commit that inverses the changes specified. It is a safer alternative to git reset.
 Clean - This command removes untracked files from your current git branch.
